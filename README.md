# dropout-data-sci
SC1015 Mini Project, doing data science and machine learning on student dropout kaggle dataset.  

### Description
In the jupyter notebook, we did a study on Student Academic Success. We attempted a classification problem on predicting whether a student would dropout.

Things we used: 
- Pandas and Seaborn to do EDA
- SciKit to do LOF, IsolationForest, KNN, DecisionTree

columns.info and data_attribute_classes.png desccribe the dataset, and was sourced from the data source.

### Contributions
- EDA, OHE, Balancing, Anomaly Removal - Terence
- EDA, KNN - Sharmilla
- Decision Tree - Ninette
